# Listings page

## Start up

1. Ensure Node is installed
2. Clone the repo
3. `cd listings-page`
4. `npm i`
5. `npm run dev`

## Tests

`npm run test`

**Note** - As testing was not a requirement, I have only created a couple of test files. This is to give an insight towards my testing style.

## Usage notes

The project is setup to immediately redirect to `/toilets`, however, the solution works with all product types so feel free to try out other product lines (e.g. `/baths`).
